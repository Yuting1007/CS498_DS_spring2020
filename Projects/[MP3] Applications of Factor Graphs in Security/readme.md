# Mini Project 3: Applications of Factor Graphs in Security

The goal of this project is to understand the progression of a multi-stage attack that aims to leak secret keys
from target system. In this project, you will perform analysis of a multi-stage attack recreated from publicly
available information on the Equifax breach. You will explore the use of signature-based, anomaly-based, and
factor graph-based techniques.

As a defender, you are given monitoring logs to perform the following tasks:
- Compare the attacker’s behavior vs. legitimate users’ behavior (Task 1)
- Build a simple factor graph for a single event and a single attack stage (Task 2)
- Extend the factor graph to capture the evolution of a series of events (Task 3)
- Run inference on attack stages using the extended factor graph (Task 3)
